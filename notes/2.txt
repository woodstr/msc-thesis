predict 4 points with hourglass method? Then apply affine transformation for rectification!
Could replace bounding boxes alltogether!
Then YOLO with matching grid dimensions for decoding!?

Only YOLO for localizing modules and decoding! Only predicts x,y. If prediction there, yk bit is 1.
If prediction not there, yk bit is 0.

Try YOLO decoding with good examples first (matching YOLO grid)!

Also try stacked hourglass model for detecting 4 channels with heatmaps (gaussian distributed?) for points.
Probably start with 3 stacks.
For training alter synthesis for making relevant heatmaps etc.
